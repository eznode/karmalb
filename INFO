This repo should contain everything needed to create a Karma Load Balancer (KLB)
installation ISO image.

The layout of the repo is as follows:
./setup-build-env.sh - should contain enough configuration to create a suitable
build environment on a standard Jessie Operating System.  If anything is missing
please update the script.

src - contains all source files.  These are used to build custom packages used
in the installation of the Karma Load Balancer.

distro - contains scripts to build the iso image itself.  You will need to
build all the sources before running the scripts here as they will be expected
to have already been built.
